# Path Finding A* Algorithm

This solution has been developed for an university project. It is an implementation of A* algorithm used for different path finding problems. Bigger the map, greater the difficulty. 
While running the suggestion is to use the keyboard instead buttons for commands.  

# Commands:

## Right click
Set Start and Ends

## Left click
Set barriers

## Press O
